## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user chatting with the AI assistant, I want to easily copy any response message so that I can paste the content into other applications or documents for later use.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a chat conversation with AI responses, **When** I look at any assistant message, **Then** I see a copy icon displayed prominently and always visible
2. **Given** an assistant message with a copy icon, **When** I click the copy icon, **Then** the raw text content is copied to my clipboard and I receive visual feedback confirming the copy action
3. **Given** multiple assistant messages in a conversation, **When** I scroll through the chat, **Then** each assistant message displays its own copy icon independently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when clipboard access is denied by the browser?
- How does the system handle copying very long messages (>1000 characters)?
- What feedback is shown if the copy operation fails?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a copy icon for every assistant response message
- **FR-002**: Copy icon MUST be always visible (not hidden behind hover states)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to click the copy icon to copy the message content
- **FR-004**: System MUST copy the raw text content (without formatting or markdown)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual feedback when copy operation succeeds
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle copy operation failures gracefully
- **FR-007**: Each message MUST have its own independent copy functionality

### Key Entities
